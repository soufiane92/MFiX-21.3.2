This tutorial uses polydisperse gas-solid suspensions 
with a fluid-particle drag relation developed by Holloway, Yin, and Sundaresan (HYS) for 
polydisperse (particles of different size/density) suspensions of spherical particles.  This case
is a 0-D periodic channel with a pressure gradient imposed in the y-direction (delp_y) to balance
the weight of the particles.  The particles have the same density, but different diameters.  In this
folder there are results for the particle and fluid phase velocities to compare with your results.

A detailed document outlining the HYS drag formulation can be found in 
~/mfix/doc with the new release of MFIX in September 2009.
