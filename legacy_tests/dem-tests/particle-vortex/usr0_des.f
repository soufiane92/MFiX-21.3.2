!  Purpose: This routine is called before the discrete phase time loop !
!  and is user-definable. The user may insert code in this routine or  !
!  call appropriate user defined subroutines.                          !
!                                                                      !
!  This routine is not called from a loop, hence all indicies are      !
!  undefined.                                                          !
