!  Module name: USR1                                                   C
!  Purpose: This routine is called from the time loop and is           C
!           user-definable.  The user may insert code in this routine  C
!           or call appropriate user defined subroutines.  This        C
!           can be used for setting or checking errors in quantities   C
!           that vary with time.  This routine is not called from an   C
!           IJK loop, hence all indices are undefined.                 C               C
